# Plato - the RPG
Plato is a whimsical role-playing game vaguely based off of OMOCAT's *OMORI*. Play as Timmy Tinkleton in a world of child's imagination, and explore towns of treats, collect sweets, and uncover the horror known as **TOOTH DECAY**...
## Intentions
Plato is my first major C++ project and my first ever game written without an engine. Plato is written using SDL3 and will contain 100% original work (though my friend @haininj may help me along the way).<br>
Plato was designed to be entertainment, a side project, a challenge. There is a decent chance Plato ends up indefinitely with no end in sight. Hopefully, that is not the case.
## Forecast
Monday night sees a 50% chance of a light drizzle as temperatures begin to cool...<br>
Plato is a game that encourages exploration and going against the grain, while also presenting a storyline guided by in game narration and inferencing. Plato is not meant to be played in any one strict way.
## Completion Status
* **INITIAL SETUP**: Basic entity and tileset rendering, basic controls and camera, temporary textures
* More coming soon... I'll keep you updated...
